# Data-Structures

This repository will hold all of Eytan and Baraks personal implementations of commonly used Data Structures in java.

Every class will implement a different data structure and similar structures will be grouped together in the same package.

All classes will be polymorphic to increase their usability.

All the source code will be stored in the src folder.
